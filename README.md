# Data Structures in C

## Introduction

This repository provides implementations of fundamental data structures in C. The goal is to offer students a hands-on guide to understanding how data structures work and how they are built. Each data structure includes a brief explanation, implementation details, and example usage.

## Getting Started

To use any of the data structures, clone the repository and navigate to the desired structure's folder. Each folder contains the necessary C files, a Makefile (if needed), and an example program to demonstrate the usage of the data structure.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/datastructures-in-c.git
cd datastructures-in-c
```

## Each section contains the following:

1. Overview: A brief explanation of the data structure.
2. Implementation: The C implementation with detailed comments.
3. Usage: Example code demonstrating how to use the data structure.
4. Complexity Analysis: A breakdown of time and space complexity for the key operations.

## How to Contribute
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add more data structures or improve the existing ones, please follow these steps:

Fork the repository.
Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
Make your changes and commit them (git commit -m 'Add new feature').
Push to the branch (git push origin feature-branch).
Create a pull request.
